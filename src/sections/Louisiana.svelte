                In a 2023 <a target="_blank" href="https://louisianacommercialrealty.com/2025/04/11/louisiana-commercial-realty-uncovers-loan-discrimination-in-new-orleans-housing/">report</a>, it was found that African Americans in the New Orleansâ€“Metairie area were 
                denied home loans at rates up to <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:#D2042D;">55% higher</span> than White applicants in the same income bracket.            </ObservedArticleText>

            <ObservedArticleText callback={addBackground} {options}>
                Furthermore, in 2023, while 22,701 loans were approved totaling $3 billion, 
                African American applicants were <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:#D2042D;">denied loans worth $319 million</span>, representing about 32% of their applications.

            <ObservedArticleText callback={addBackground} {options}>
                This denial rate of 32% for African Americans is <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:#D2042D;">
                    nearly double</span> that of White applicants at 18%.

                Louisiana Commercial Realty,</a> we observe that across all income brackets, there is a greater rate of

                <p style="text-align:center;">The Louisiana Commercial Realty explains that the excess denials 
                    that occur in the income bracket exceeding 100% of the New Orleans MSA average totals $75 million.

                <p style="text-align:center;">What does this look like for homeowners? Well, since the average loan application was $201,000, that would have denied an
