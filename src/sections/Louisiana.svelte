                In a 2023 <a target="_blank" href="https://louisianacommercialrealty.com/2025/04/11/louisiana-commercial-realty-uncovers-loan-discrimination-in-new-orleans-housing/">report</a>, it was found that African Americans in the New Orleansâ€“Metairie area were 
                denied home loans at rates up to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">55% higher</span> than White applicants in the same income bracket.
                <!-- Homeownership is crucial in accumulating wealth through investments.  -->

            <ObservedArticleText callback={addBackground} {options}>
                Furthermore, in 2023, while 22,701 loans were approved totaling $3 billion, 
                African American applicants were denied loans worth $319 million, representing about 32% of their applications.
            </ObservedArticleText>
            <ObservedArticleText callback={addBackground} {options}>
                This denial rate of 32% for African Americans is nearly double that of White applicants at 18%.
