                You might notice that this basic template doesn't have certain
                features that are common in scrollytelling.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                For example, you might want a component that doesn't feature a
                sticky component at all. Or a component that is solely a sticky
                component.

            <ArticleText>
                You might also want to add more interactivity or gamify parts of
                your scrollytelling piece.
